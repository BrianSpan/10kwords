# The purpose of this code is not to reinvent the wheel but to show that I can scrape the web.


  

### Features:  
Recursive backtracking algorithm  
1D array instead of the traditional 2D array  
Pygame visualization that can be toggled  
Efficient cell checking for completeness  

Constant DISPLAYPROGRESS can be set to True or False to toggle whether displayed in Pygame

### Future upgrades:  
This is just a demonstration of solving a sample sudoku so one puzzle is hardcoded in with options to uncomment others.  
Future improvements could include the possibility to load a puzzle.   

### Requirements:  
Python 3.7+  
Pygame (if DISPLAYPROGRESS is True)
